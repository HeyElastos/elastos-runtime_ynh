## What Carrier Is

**Carrier is the decentralized communication and content substrate of an ElastOS node.** It handles peer discovery, messaging, relay, and peer-to-peer content transfer for `elastos://` operations.

Carrier is not the whole runtime. The runtime hosts Carrier and enforces capabilities, sessions, routing, and lifecycle around it. Carrier is also not a specific protocol implementation. The transport underneath (iroh today, Carrier Native/Boson tomorrow) is an implementation detail.

## Capsule Model

From a capsule's perspective, Carrier just works. A capsule calls `peer/gossip_send` and messages appear on every subscribed node. The capsule doesn't know or care whether it's running as native, WASM, or microVM, or whether it's on a Jetson, WSL, or a laptop.

**Same machine:** All capsules share one runtime, one Carrier node, one gossip buffer. Messages between native chat and WASM chat on the same machine go through the shared buffer — instant, no network needed.

**Cross machine:** Each machine has its own runtime and Carrier node with its own DID. Messages travel via iroh gossip mesh (QUIC + DHT + relay). From the capsule's perspective, this is invisible — `peer/gossip_send` works the same way.

### Carrier vs. Elastos Carrier Native / Boson

The Elastos Foundation's Carrier (v1: C SDK, v2: DHT+services) and Boson (permissionless fork) are the closest historical analogs. In this runtime's model they are candidate backend implementations for the Carrier substrate. The contract stays stable; the transport can change.

### Carrier vs. `elastos://`

`elastos://` is the native namespace exposed to capsules and users.

Carrier is not identical to `elastos://`:

- Carrier gives decentralized peer/content semantics to the relevant parts of `elastos://`
- the runtime routes and authorizes `elastos://` operations
- providers define the meaning of subspaces such as `elastos://peer/`, `elastos://did/`, and `elastos://ai/`

Clean mental model:

- `elastos://` = namespace / contract surface
- Carrier = decentralized substrate behind peer/content operations
- runtime = trusted node core that hosts Carrier and enforces policy

### Where HTTP Fits

HTTP is not Carrier. In this repo it plays three supporting roles:

1. **Node-local control API**
   - `elastos-server` exposes an HTTP API for capability requests, provider dispatch, session handling, and orchestration.
   - This is runtime control-plane traffic, not Carrier semantics.

2. **Browser / gateway compatibility**
   - HTTPS gateway URLs are convenience access paths for browsers and installers.
   - Trust should still come from hashes, signatures, and trusted DIDs, not from HTTP itself.

3. **Tunnel / edge bridging**
   - `tunnel-provider` and similar components can expose services over HTTP(S) to the public web.
   - That is an interoperability edge, not the definition of Carrier.

### Identity: DID (not device_key)

All Carrier identity is `did:key` — an Ed25519 key encoded as `did:key:z6Mk...`. The DID is deterministically derived from the device key via `SHA-256("elastos-did-v1" || device_key)`. The device_key file stays on disk for encryption at rest, but external identity is always DID.

Chat sessions use ephemeral DIDs (random SigningKey per session). The seed node and `elastos serve` use stable DIDs derived from the persisted device key.

## Node Planes

### 1. Node Core / Control Plane (host ↔ capsule)

The trusted orchestration layer around Carrier. Manages capsule lifecycle, capability grants, session auth, provider dispatch, and audit.

**Current implementation:**
- `elastos-server` (CLI + HTTP API)
- `elastos-runtime` (capability authority, request handler)
- `elastos-identity`, `elastos-tls`, `elastos-namespace`

**Transport:** serial Carrier bridge for ordinary VM app capsules, HTTP over private guest network only for capsules that explicitly need guest IP bridging, and stdio JSON for host-native services.

HTTP here is a control-plane protocol. It is not the Carrier substrate.

### 2. Carrier Network + Content Plane (node ↔ world)

Peer discovery, gossip messaging, relay, and peer-to-peer content transfer. Built into the runtime as `carrier.rs`.

**Current implementation:**
- Built-in Carrier node using **iroh** (QUIC, gossip, mDNS, relay)
- `tunnel-provider` capsule using **cloudflared** (HTTP tunnel to public internet)

**Transport:** iroh (QUIC + pkarr + relay). Target: interoperability with Elastos Carrier Native / Boson when those ecosystems mature.

### 3. Data Plane (host ↔ VM networking)

The physical network plumbing connecting each VM to the host.

**Current implementation:**
- `elastos-crosvm/network.rs`: TAP devices via ioctl, /30 subnets, host-only link (no iptables, no ip_forward)
- TAP is no longer the default for ordinary app capsules; it is used when a capsule explicitly needs guest IP networking or a TCP bridge
- Carrier serial bridge is the preferred control path for regular app capsules

**Transport:** Linux TAP (host-only) when guest networking is explicitly enabled. Otherwise, app capsules use the serial Carrier bridge and avoid guest networking entirely.

## Naming in Code

The codebase currently uses "Carrier" in a broader way than this document recommends. Specific usages:

| Term in Code | Meaning | Sub-Plane |
|---|---|---|
| `CarrierNode` | Built-in P2P node (iroh endpoint + gossip) | Network Plane |
| `CarrierGossipProvider` | Provider trait impl for `elastos://peer/*` | Network Plane |
| `start_carrier_node()` | Starts the built-in Carrier node with DID identity | Network Plane |
| "Carrier control link" | legacy name for host↔VM control plumbing (now serial bridge by default, TAP only for explicit guest-network cases) | Data / Control Plane |
| `CarrierServiceBridge` | Host-native provider process (stdio JSON) | Node Core / Control Plane |
| `CapsuleBackend::Carrier` | Capsule runs on host (not in VM) | Node Core / Control Plane |
| `permissions.carrier: true` | Capsule needs host-level network access | Control + Network |
| `tunnel-provider` | Public HTTP tunnel via cloudflared | Network Plane |

Recommended reading:

- terms like `CarrierNode` still fit the historical/network meaning
- terms like "Carrier control link" are implementation legacy and should be read as node-control/data-plane plumbing, not as the definition of Carrier itself

## Why Carrier Is Built-In (Not a Capsule)

The ElastOS principle says "everything is a capsule." Carrier is the exception because it does two things:

1. **Bootstrap transport** — file serving, trusted source discovery, and update fetch. These must work BEFORE any capsule infrastructure is available. A capsule can't provide the transport needed to download itself.

2. **Gossip provider** — the `elastos://peer/*` scheme for chat and agent. This shares the same iroh endpoint as the bootstrap transport. Extracting it to a capsule would mean either two iroh endpoints (wasteful) or a shared-endpoint mechanism between runtime and capsule (complex).

The earlier `peer-provider` capsule was the capsule form of this. It was superseded when Carrier was integrated into the runtime for reliability and simplicity, and it is no longer part of the active tree.

**Future:** When the gossip protocol stabilizes, the gossip provider portion of Carrier could be extracted back into a capsule, using the runtime's iroh endpoint via a shared-endpoint API. This is tracked as a later task, not a current priority.

## Open Questions

1. **Inter-capsule communication.** VMs currently cannot talk to each other — only to the host. Carrier should eventually provide capsule-to-capsule channels mediated by the runtime (capability-gated, audited).

2. **Convergence with Carrier Native v2.** The DHT+services model of Carrier v2 maps well to the provider model here. But no integration work has started. Is this a priority?
