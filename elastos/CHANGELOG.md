# Changelog

All notable changes to the public ElastOS Runtime repository.

## [Next]

### Added
- Added runtime authority primitives for proof-bound authentication: principals, proof bindings, SIWE challenges, session grants, and audit events.
- Added EVM SIWE challenge, verify, and revoke gateway routes that bind verified wallet proofs to runtime principals and issue scoped Home/System launch grants.
- Added `chain-provider` as the first blockchain provider capsule: typed `elastos://chain/*` access for Essentials-compatible Elastos networks without exposing raw RPC URLs to app capsules.
- Added wallet approval approve/complete states, Inbox review entries, WebConnect-style handoff metadata, and signature receipt hashes without exposing wallet signatures to app capsules.
- Added passkey-controlled built-in EVM wallet creation through Wallet, with provider-owned encrypted key storage and managed signing only after Wallet/Inbox review plus fresh passkey confirmation in Wallet.
- Added fresh passkey-bound gates for built-in wallet signatures, Wallet send, account deletion, and Wallet recovery-key export/import so long-lived app launch tokens cannot execute managed-wallet authority by themselves.
- Bound managed-wallet private-key envelopes to principal/account/chain/address metadata using AES-GCM AAD and principal-derived storage keys, with tamper tests for cross-principal/chain metadata changes.
- Removed internal wallet storage object paths from wallet-provider init/status responses; consumers now see only configured booleans and counts.
- Hardened `wallet-provider` request parsing so hidden signing authority, connector wallet objects, and extra wallet fields fail at decode time.
- Added a dedicated `wallet-metamask` connector capsule for MetaMask SIWE linking and external wallet approval completion, keeping browser wallet authority out of System.
- Added connector-bound external wallet links and approval completion so EVM wallet proofs and signatures can only be finished by the dedicated connector capsule that owns the account.
- Generalized external wallet connector approval/account routes behind an allowlisted connector-capsule path, keeping MetaMask working while preventing unknown connector capsules from receiving wallet handoffs.
- Added PC2 convergence documentation and provider-resource tests that translate PC2 wallet bridge method classes into Runtime wallet/chain scopes while rejecting raw EIP-1193 methods as provider operations.
- Added typed chain proof, EVM transaction prepare, signed transaction broadcast, and node lifecycle status scopes to `chain-provider`.
- Hardened `chain-provider` request parsing so hidden raw transaction and node RPC fields fail at decode time before provider logic runs.
- Added signable EIP-155 legacy transaction intents from `chain-provider` and built-in wallet transaction signing after Runtime approval, while external wallet transaction signing remains connector-bound.
- Added ERC-1271 smart-account SIWE proof verification through a typed `chain-provider` proof followed by wallet-provider challenge consumption, keeping smart-account proof checks out of app capsules.
- Added typed Bitcoin BIP-322 simple proof challenge/verification for Bitcoin mainnet native P2WPKH addresses, with wrong-message and unsupported-script paths failing closed behind `elastos://wallet/proof/bip322/*`.
- Added connector-token-scoped BTC wallet-link routes for BIP-322 challenge/verify so a connector capsule can bind a Bitcoin proof to the existing passkey principal without minting a Home session or exposing raw wallet/node authority.
- Added manual BIP-322 proof-link handoff inside the visible `wallet` capsule, keeping MetaMask EVM-only until a documented Bitcoin dapp signing API exists.
- Added a dormant `wallet-walletconnect` connector capsule UI that stays hidden/unroutable until operator-pinned WalletConnect config and a local Reown/AppKit adapter hash are present.
- Added a WalletConnect connector config utility and smoke proof that copy a local reviewed adapter into the runtime data dir and pin its sha256 before the connector can launch.
- Added an exact-version WalletConnect adapter build script for producing the local Reown/AppKit adapter bundle used by the connector gate.
- Added an entropy guard proving WalletConnect requires an explicit operator Project ID and local SDK hash pinning, with no repository or environment default Project ID.
- Added a visible Wallet surface that replaces the old Bitcoin-first wallet app with accounts, native ESC/Base/BTC balance reads through `chain-provider`, default-account selection, approval review, and connector handoffs as approval methods.
- Added the first visible `browser` capsule shell with explicit `elastos://wallet/*` and `elastos://net/*` capability intent, a Glide default URL for testing, and honest cross-origin wallet-injection boundaries until the native/webview or microVM Browser/Net/Exit adapter exists.
- Added `net-provider` as the first fail-closed Browser/Net boundary: it validates Browser requests, blocks LAN/private targets, rejects hidden raw authority fields, and returns an explicit `exit_unavailable` handoff instead of touching host networking itself.
- Added `exit-provider` as the internal Browser egress contract with fail-closed `quote`, `open_stream`, `close_stream`, and `http_fetch` operations for future local, Carrier-routed, privacy, paid, or enterprise exit backends.
- Added the first constrained Browser egress proofs: `/api/provider/net/http` and `/api/provider/net/stream` now validate through `net-provider` and then hand off internally to operator-configured `exit-provider` `http_fetch` or `stream_relay` backends with host allowlists, body limits where bytes are returned, and private-target blocking by default.
- Moved the visible Browser preview request path from HTTP fetch to stream-session reservation so the UI exercises the intended browser path and reports `byte_transport: not_attached` until a Browser Engine Adapter exists.
- Added `browser-engine-adapter` as the internal Browser Engine Adapter contract with fail-closed `status`, `launch`, `attach_stream`, and `close_page` operations; it requires explicit operator config and attached `adapter_ipc` byte transport before any page launch can succeed.
- Added `/api/apps/browser/open` as the high-level Browser product route that performs Runtime-owned Net validation, Exit stream reservation, and Browser Engine Adapter launch without exposing raw Exit or Browser Engine provider routes to ordinary capsules.
- Added Browser Session Manager proof surfaces: launch reservations, per-principal/total capacity receipts, page heartbeats, stale active-page cleanup, and smokes that prove concurrent Home-launched Browser pages close without leaving capacity behind.
- Added a protected-content Browser reachability smoke for the known `ela.city` item route. This is intentionally scoped to route/session cleanup and does not claim purchase, key release, decrypt, or playback readiness.
- Added typed `elastos.adapter-ipc/v1` descriptors for configured Browser stream backends and stripped those private endpoint descriptors from Browser UI responses while passing them to the internal Browser Engine Adapter.
- Added typed `elastos.exit.relay-ipc/v1` descriptors for private Exit relay sockets; Gateway uses them only internally to relay bytes from the Runtime-owned Browser stream socket to an operator/Carrier exit daemon, strips them from Browser UI, and never passes them to the Browser Engine Adapter.
- Added the Browser Engine native supervisor handshake: Runtime sends `elastos.browser.engine.launch-request/v1` through `ELASTOS_BROWSER_ENGINE_REQUEST`, and native adapters only launch when the supervisor returns a validated `elastos.browser.engine.supervisor-result/v1` with runtime-net-only, no-direct-network, and no-wallet-injection proofs.
- Added `browser-engine-supervisor` as the first Linux host helper for native browser engines: it validates operator config, starts the configured engine under `linux_new_netns`, and passes only stream/IPC/target/URL environment to the child process.
- Added `browser-stream-bridge` as the first Linux local byte-transport helper for Browser Engine work: it forwards between a private engine Unix socket and a Runtime-owned Unix stream socket without TCP, DNS, HTTP, wallet, chain, or raw host-network authority; the supervisor can launch it before the native engine through `ELASTOS_BROWSER_STREAM_BRIDGE_CONFIG`.
- Added Runtime-owned Browser stream socket path allocation: Gateway injects a private `Runtime/BrowserStreams/*.sock` path into the internal Browser Engine launch descriptor, binds it as a local Unix listener, closes fail-closed when no private Exit relay exists, and keeps `adapter_ipc`/`relay_ipc` hidden from Browser UI responses.
- Added `browser-local-exit` as the first server-side Browser Exit relay: Runtime sends a typed `elastos.exit.relay-open/v1` handshake to its private Unix socket, and the helper dials only operator-allowlisted public targets while blocking private resolved IPs by default.
- Changed Home launch so the Browser capsule opens as an ElastOS window instead of escaping into a host browser tab.
- Added persistent typed node-lifecycle state to `chain-provider`, including reload coverage that does not persist or return raw node RPC URLs.
- Added proof-bound Recovery Kit export/import request routes that validate principal/root binding, require active Home/System authority, and record signed audit denials.
- Added validated principal-root protection state so recovery status can report verified recovery protection without allowing cross-principal protection records to bleed across users.
- Added proof-bound Recovery Kit creation/import/export: the runtime generates a per-principal data key, wraps it to a recovery phrase, stores a runtime-encrypted downloadable archive plus protector metadata, and verifies encrypted root descriptors on import.
- Added optional password-packaged Recovery Kit downloads and password-verified package import so users can protect the offline kit file without giving apps raw recovery authority.
- Added public route-level Recovery Kit coverage for create, status, password-packaged export, wrong-password rejection, and verified import through `/api/auth/recovery/*`.
- Added contract-level WebAuthn PRF recovery-protector validation so PRF protectors must use `webauthn-prf` envelopes and cannot carry Recovery Kit archives.
- Hardened runtime WebAuthn response parsing so hidden extension payloads such as `clientExtensionResults` are rejected until client-side PRF wrapping exists.
- Added contract-level DID recovery-protector validation so DID protectors must identify a `did:key` or `did:elastos` subject, use DID-bound envelope metadata, and cannot masquerade as downloadable Recovery Kits.
- Hardened principal-root protection and Recovery Kit contracts so hidden or unknown nested fields fail during decode instead of being accepted and ignored.
- Added a typed `did-provider` recovery-proof verification operation for `did:key` subjects that binds the proof to principal, root, protector, data-key ID, nonce, and expiry.
- Hardened `did-provider` request parsing so hidden fields on typed DID recovery and chat-signing requests are rejected instead of being accepted and ignored.
- Hardened all `op`-tagged provider request contracts to reject unknown top-level fields, covering Documents, localhost, IPFS, availability, protected-content, AI, WebSpace, tunnel, and provider bridge operation envelopes.
- Hardened protected-content object and request contracts so sealed objects, key envelopes, key-release requests, decrypt-session requests, DRM open requests, rights checks, and availability ensure calls reject hidden nested authority fields at decode time.
- Hardened browser-facing gateway request bodies so Home state, System settings, wallet approvals, Home launches, Inbox actions, chat access, room messages, and upload starts reject hidden authority fields at decode time.
- Hardened capability API request bodies so request, grant, deny, revoke-all, and audit query inputs reject hidden authority fields at decode time.
- Wired Recovery Kit import to consume typed DID recovery proofs through `did-provider` only when they match an existing DID recovery protector on the recovered root, preserving that protector without claiming DID-only recovery.
- Added System smoke coverage for Recovery Kit password-protected download and import controls so the user-visible recovery path stays tested.
- Added Home smoke coverage for Recovery Kit controls inside the Home-launched System frame.
- Added `scripts/recovery-kit-live-smoke.sh` so signed browser sessions can prove live Recovery Kit status/download/import without silent mutation; it accepts a copied token, Cookie header, or cookie jar from the signed Home session.
- Fixed the live Recovery Kit smoke script to validate the current `elastos.principal.root-recovery.status/v1` schema before export/import.
- Added `scripts/auth-wallet-focus-smoke.sh` as a repeatable gate for the branch's passkey, recovery, recovery-protector contract, capsule-bridge principal storage, principal-launch, System managed-wallet route, wallet, BTC, typed chain proof/prepare/broadcast, chain sync-health, node lifecycle, entropy, and alignment checks.
- Extended the auth/wallet focus smoke with MetaMask connector and Wallet Bitcoin-proof journey filters.
- Added Home Chat Room launch coverage to the auth/wallet focus gate so Home-to-runtime launches must use signed `launch_grant` authority and never raw `principal_id`.
- Added explicit Recovery Kit root reassignment: System can import a verified kit for an existing principal root, rebind the active passkey to that root, reissue Home/System session tokens, restore included built-in Wallet keys, and record signed audit.
- Hardened Recovery Kit root reassignment so recovery replaces old passkey-root bindings, revokes their sessions, and public handler coverage proves the response rotates the Home session cookie after reassignment.
- Hardened System Recovery Kit import so recovering an account requires an explicit in-surface `Recover account` action instead of silent reassignment.
- Added runtime-enforced principal-root object encryption for protected roots: Documents working copies, Home browser state, and viewer/content storage now write AES-256-GCM envelopes bound to principal, root, data-key ID, and object URI, and reject plaintext reads for protected roots.
- Fixed protected-root Home loading so old plaintext browser-state files are treated as untrusted UI state and reset to a clean default instead of causing a 500 or being accepted as data.
- Hardened the legacy generic `/api/localhost/*` storage handler so `Users/*` roots fail closed without a runtime principal-scoped provider route.
- Updated the Home CLI `Users` root descriptor to show principal-root storage instead of the obsolete shared `Users/self` alias.
- Removed stale shared `Users/self` examples from generic capability/provider-resource tests so only principal-scoped bridge paths keep that alias.
- Removed the stale shared `Users/self` path from VM provider path-shaping tests.
- Added an entropy guard that only allows `Users/self` in approved scoped-alias code, capsule manifests, and regression tests.
- Renamed the System account display field from Handle to Name so local profile copy is not confused with global name-claim semantics.
- Added `scripts/protected-home-state-smoke.sh` to prove the protected Home browser-state reset regression and live unsigned Home summary path before handing browser-visible changes back for testing.
- Added passkey revocation policy coverage proving admins can revoke guest passkeys without revoking their own session while guest-to-admin and last-admin removal still fail closed.
- Clarified WebAuthn RP authority handling so Host-derived same-origin requests are not described as a fallback around malformed browser origins.
- Added admin-controlled guest passkey promotion through a runtime auth route and System action, with guest self-promotion rejected.
- Added admin-controlled admin passkey demotion through a runtime auth route and System action, while rejecting self-demotion and last-admin demotion.
- Removed the unsigned Home unlock copy flicker so the passkey card starts with the final sign-in message instead of a temporary checking message.
- Simplified Home sign-in so the browser passkey chooser opens automatically, sign-in no longer shows the passkey-name field or leaked form label, and guest creation is a separate flow.
- Fixed Home passkey cancellation so dismissed browser passkey prompts show a clean `No passkey selected` state with `Create guest account` still available.
- Fixed Home/System appearance state so wallpaper and overlay preferences are stored under the active passkey principal root instead of a shared runtime bucket.
- Clarified Wallet UI language around Accounts and Approval methods so MetaMask, Bitcoin, WalletConnect, and passkey-managed signing read as connector-backed approval paths under one Wallet model instead of separate wallet products.
- Cleaned Wallet Approval Methods so linked accounts are removable from Wallet after fresh passkey confirmation, MetaMask can add another account, WalletConnect remains disabled without pinned operator config, Ledger stays hidden until implemented, and UniSat is not advertised as available from hosted Browser environments.
- Added principal-scoped WASM launch plumbing: Home-backed runtime launches forward the signed launch-token principal into WASM bridge pipes so capsule-facing `localhost://Users/self` can resolve through the runtime principal root instead of a shared alias.
- Routed protected in-runtime capsule-kernel `localhost://Users/self` read/write calls through the runtime principal-root object envelope when a Home launch principal is present, and made attached/remote bridge user-root storage fail closed until it has the same protected bridge, preventing protected user-root state from falling through to generic localhost-provider storage.
- Added route-level rejection tests for `/api/capsules` raw principal injection so supplied `principal_id` values fail closed before reaching the runtime bridge.
- Replaced raw `/api/capsules` principal injection from Home with a signed, app-scoped `launch_grant`; raw `principal_id` launch authority is now rejected even when it is paired with a grant.
- Tightened managed Home/chat runtime policy so capability grants target principal-root storage, while the capsule bridge rejects explicit foreign `localhost://Users/<root>` requests before approval prompts.
- Fixed managed runtime-backed Home launches so Chat Room and other app capsules can validate signed principal launch grants instead of failing with `principal launch grant unavailable`.
- Hardened the shell/supervisor microVM launch path so it accepts the same signed app-scoped `launch_grant`, rejects raw `principal_id`/`home_token` authority and authority-shaped config, passes the verified principal into the microVM Carrier bridge, and refuses provider-role user scope.
- Added System-gateway coverage for `chain-provider` node lifecycle status so lifecycle checks use the same launch-token and capability-resource path as other System chain diagnostics.
- Added operator-approved loopback node supervisor control to `chain-provider` for start/stop/restart without returning raw node URLs, ports, command paths, or process handles.
- Added System node lifecycle controls that appear only when `chain-provider` reports `control_available=true`; remote/public RPC networks stay status-only.
- Added wallet approval journey coverage: provider-created typed signature requests appear in Wallet/Inbox, approval executes managed signing, and completion records signed audit without exposing wallet authority to apps.
- Added provider-backed default wallet routing: System selects the principal's default account, and typed signature requests must name `chain_namespace + intent` before the wallet-provider resolves a default or verifies an explicit same-chain account.
- Added anti-drift checks that block ordinary app/viewer/content capsules from referencing raw wallet, chain, node, RPC, WalletConnect, MetaMask, or blockchain-provider authority directly.
- Added shared protected-content schemas and a fail-closed `drm-provider` contract for `elastos://drm/meta/status` and `elastos://drm/open`.
- Added `rights-provider` as the typed, fail-closed protected-content policy boundary for access, subscription, stream, and download questions.
- Added `key-provider` as the typed, fail-closed protected-content key-release boundary for PQ-hybrid dKMS requests.
- Added `decrypt-provider` as the typed, fail-closed protected-content decrypt/render session boundary.
- Added a canonical `drm-provider.status.required_sequence` for protected-content open orchestration before backend wiring.
- Added Runtime-owned release receipt and audit steps to the protected-content open sequence.
- Added the same machine-readable required sequence and runtime events to fail-closed `drm-provider.open` responses.
- Added `scripts/protected-content-provider-contract-smoke.sh` to exercise protected-content provider capsules through their real JSON line protocol.
- Added `scripts/installed-provider-verify.sh` so installed provider binaries can be checked against the installed `components.json` before live browser testing.
- Added alignment checks and release-story documentation so the protected-content provider journey proof stays visible in `TASKS.md`, `state.md`, and the runtime repo checklist.
- Added algorithm metadata to protected-content key envelopes so sealed objects can declare cipher, signature, KEM, and share-scheme choices for PQ-hybrid dKMS work.
- Enforced protected-content key-envelope algorithm allowlists for AES-256/ChaCha20 payload encryption, hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM share wrapping, and classical + PQ signatures.

### Changed
- Upgraded Home launch tokens to carry principal, session, proof-binding, grant, expiry, and non-delegation context, with active-session validation for proof-bound tokens.
- Aligned principles, roadmap, capsule model, and Carrier docs around the local-and-off-box Carrier plane and blockchain quadrant authority model.
- Added an explicit `blockchain` setup profile and release/build support for `chain-provider` while keeping it out of the default Home profile.
- Enforced carrier-only authority for ordinary app/viewer/content capsule manifests and added repo-wide alignment checks for forbidden manifest authority.
- Moved the headless agent capsule from direct runtime HTTP calls to the guest Carrier-kernel SDK and added an alignment check against direct host-route usage in ordinary Rust/WASM app capsules.
- Made the capsule bridge reject raw runtime-control requests with an explicit `not_capsule_kernel_abi` error so app capsules stay on capability/`carrier_invoke` calls.
- Removed raw shell/runtime-control, direct storage, direct provider routing, and direct capsule-message helpers from the guest SDK so capsule code only sees capability requests and `carrier_invoke`.
- Moved first-party chat, agent, and Home CLI capsules from `provider_call(scheme, op)` to the URI-based `carrier_invoke(uri, operation)` capsule-kernel ABI.
- Documented the older `elastos-runtime` handler as an internal shell/control protocol, not the public guest SDK, and added a test that `carrier_invoke` stays on the Carrier bridge.
- Added browser-host-adapter proof that attached WASM capsules cannot use HTTP bridge routes for raw runtime control.
- Required provider capsule manifests to declare their owned `provides` namespace, including the WebSpaces resolver.
- Required provider capsule manifests to declare provider-authority metadata with reason strings, capability schemas, operation lists, and expected audit events.
- Added a built-in `content` provider seam above `ipfs-provider` and moved Documents publish/unpublish onto that availability contract with honest local availability status.
- Made `elastos://ipfs/*` a system-only backend at the capability request surface so ordinary capsules must use `elastos://content/*`.
- Added signed local availability receipts for content publish/unpublish and exposed the latest receipt through `elastos://content/status`.
- Moved site publish/activate CID creation onto the `elastos://content/*` path while keeping `ipfs-provider` as the low-level backend.
- Moved `elastos share`, `elastos shares` channel-head updates, and `elastos attest` provenance writes onto the `elastos://content/*` path.
- Added `elastos://content/fetch` for CID/path reads and moved provenance verify/read helpers onto the content provider path.
- Routed `/s/<cid>/...` gateway file reads through `elastos://content/fetch` instead of raw `ipfs-provider` requests.
- Moved share metadata and channel-head reads onto `elastos://content/fetch`.
- Rejected ordinary app/viewer/content manifest capabilities for system-only backend namespaces such as `elastos://ipfs/*`, Kubo, IPFS Cluster, Elacity SDK, and runtime SystemServices storage.
- Added `elastos://content/repair` so the content provider can re-pin a CID locally or record a signed `repair_needed` receipt.
- Added `elastos://content/ensure` as the idempotent availability operation and made content status reject invalid CIDs instead of returning ambiguous unknown state.
- Added a registered availability-provider seam so content publish/ensure can return `network_available` or `repair_needed` when a runtime-owned replication provider verifies network availability.
- Added an `availability-provider` capsule that forwards `elastos://content/ensure` availability requests to explicitly configured Elacity/supernode-compatible targets without hardcoded public service assumptions.
- Removed stale raw-IPFS helper paths from the main command dispatcher and added an alignment guard so command materialization stays on `elastos://content/*`.
- Added deterministic `_elastos_object.json` manifests to directory publishes, giving Documents, shares, and sites a common IPLD-compatible object shape.
- Extended content object manifests with deterministic CID links plus `release` and `sealed` object kinds for release manifests and protected-content descriptors.
- Made `sealed` content object publishes fail closed unless they include `sealed.json`, payload/rights/availability/provenance links, and approved protected-content key-envelope algorithms.
- Made content directory publishes sort package entries and reject duplicate paths or unknown object kinds before bytes reach the IPFS backend.
- Made Documents unpublish receipts preserve the document owner DID instead of falling back to the runtime device DID.
- Tightened ordinary capsule manifests so apps, viewers, and content cannot declare external host dependencies, provider implementation overrides, or microVM HTTP ports.
- Unified provider capability-resource derivation across the HTTP host adapter and Carrier bridge so local and capsule-kernel calls fail closed against the same resource contract.
- Removed duplicate wallet-provider transaction prepare/broadcast declarations; typed transaction prepare/broadcast belongs to `chain-provider`, while `wallet-provider` owns approval and signing receipts.
- Narrowed `elastos://content/*` capability-resource derivation to documented publish/fetch/status/ensure/repair/unpublish operations instead of a broad content wildcard.
- Made capsule-kernel capability requests fail closed for unsupported schemes and system-only backends such as raw gateway/IPFS/Kubo/Elacity namespaces before they can create user approval prompts.
- Routed ordinary `elastos publish` capsule directory uploads through `elastos://content/*`, while leaving large MicroVM rootfs streaming on the existing explicit operator path.
- Routed `elastos open elastos://<cid>` data-capsule materialization through `elastos://content/*` and verified `_elastos_object.json` file size/hash metadata before serving.
- Routed `elastos run --cid` and `elastos serve --cid` materialization through `elastos://content/*` instead of the raw IPFS bridge.
- Routed supervisor-installed capsule artifact downloads through `elastos://content/fetch` instead of direct `ipfs` sub-provider calls.
- Routed public gateway installer publishing through `elastos://content/publish` instead of direct `ipfs` sub-provider calls.
- Added an operator `elastos content publish-object` path and release-object sidecars so public releases can expose IPLD-compatible manifest links without breaking raw installer CIDs.
- Taught release/update bookkeeping to validate and display signed `release_object_cid` values while preserving raw `latest_release_cid` installer compatibility.
- Taught `elastos open elastos://<release-object-cid>` to open release objects as verified metadata summaries and made CID materialization reject release objects as non-launchable content graphs.
- Added alignment gates so CID run/serve and public gateway publish paths cannot reintroduce raw IPFS materialization.
- Tightened passkey/WebAuthn ceremonies to require user verification in browser options and reject authenticator data without the user-verification flag.
- Added a first-class `passkey_webauthn` runtime proof-binding model so passkeys can bind principals without becoming wallet or DID replacements.
- Changed successful WebAuthn registration/authentication to return verified credential facts for runtime proof-binding issuance.
- Bound successful passkey registration/authentication into runtime auth state by upserting a passkey proof binding and issuing a short-lived Home/System session grant.
- Clarified WebAuthn RP/origin derivation so localhost development uses `http://localhost` while hosted Home uses its HTTPS origin.
- Added browser-gateway passkey register/sign-in endpoints and System passkey controls that issue Home/System launch grants without wallet-first UX.
- Promoted passkeys into the default Home entry path so fresh browsers see a Home unlock surface instead of receiving an automatic local session cookie; successful passkey registration/sign-in sets the same refresh-safe HttpOnly Home session cookie.
- Made passkey the Home front door authority: the first passkey on a runtime becomes admin, later passkeys become guest principals with their own `localhost://Users/<principal-root>` area, guest creation defaults off, and System admin controls new guest enrollment without revoking existing guests.
- Made guest passkey creation nameable and same-authenticator friendly by omitting `excludeCredentials` for new runtime principals while preserving duplicate-prevention for legacy backup-passkey registration.
- Made first Home passkey creation nameable, derived the visible handle from the active passkey principal, and documented orphaned user-root recovery semantics.
- Removed the proof-less System handle path, scoped guest passkey lists to the current guest principal, and made passkey revocation runtime-enforced so guests cannot remove admin passkeys.
- Removed admin-created guest passkeys from System; admins now only open or close guest enrollment, while guests self-register their own passkey and principal from Home when enrollment is enabled.
- Added principal-root protection and Recovery Kit contracts plus a proof-bound recovery status route that stays honest about unencrypted or unprotected roots.
- Scoped viewer/content storage such as GBA save states through the signed Home launch-token principal instead of writing under a shared literal `localhost://Users/self` directory.
- Scoped Documents provider working copies through the signed Home launch-token principal and rejected cross-principal document operations at the provider boundary.
- Removed the global notification-to-native-chat relay that wrote room events into shared `localhost://Users/self` state without an active principal.
- Made the generic capsule-kernel bridge map `localhost://Users/self` through an explicit principal context, while rejecting capability requests and carrier invokes when that context is missing.
- Made unsigned Home load as a standard non-user desktop that prompts for passkey sign-in while keeping runtime ensure, app launch, and browser state writes capability-gated.
- Aligned the Home passkey prompt with the PC2 login surface: centered dark card, ElastOS branding, amber action, and concise passkey copy without wallet-first dependencies.
- Simplified Home sign-in copy around data, apps, and desktop access and tightened toolbar spacing so the sign-out control remains fully visible.
- Simplified System into Account, Appearance, and collapsed Advanced areas so routine passkey, guest, and wallpaper settings are not mixed with runtime diagnostics.
- Renamed the visible System Advanced DID field to Device identity and clarified that passkey principals, `did:key`, `did:elastos`/EID, handles, CIDs, and IPLD object graphs are separate identity layers.
- Signed runtime audit events with the runtime DID key before persisting them in auth state.
- Kept the Home passkey card stable through status checking and signed boot so registration/sign-in does not flash through intermediate desktop states.
- Wired Home to refresh proof-bound passkey sessions through the runtime session-refresh route after signed boot and during long-lived desktops.
- Fixed proof-bound session refresh to accept the browser's HttpOnly `home-session` cookie, preventing successful passkey sign-in from falling back into the unlock prompt.
- Added explicit Home sign-out that revokes the current proof-bound session grant, clears the HttpOnly `home-session` cookie, and reloads into the unsigned passkey prompt.
- Bound Home open-window session restore to a browser-context id in site storage and de-duped restored targets so clearing browser site data cannot replay stale server-side System windows after sign-in.
- Moved Home browser layout/session/recent-target state into the active principal's `localhost://Users/<principal-root>/.AppData/ElastOS/Home/` area instead of a shared system bucket.
- Made browser-gateway passkey routes load identity state lazily and fail closed without creating identity material during unrelated reads.
- Made WebAuthn RP derivation fail closed for malformed or insecure browser origins and documented hosted Home, localhost, PWA, and future WebView adapter boundaries.
- Added proof-bound passkey list, credential revoke, and session-refresh routes for Home/System without exposing passkey controls to app capsules.
- Expanded fail-closed passkey coverage for replayed or expired challenges, wrong origin/RP, missing user verification, counter regression, missing grants, and revoked proof bindings.
- Bound multiple passkeys for the same local identity to one runtime principal and required an existing Home/System grant before adding backup passkeys.
- Replaced capsule-facing arbitrary DID `sign(data)` with a typed chat-message signing intent so the DID provider no longer exposes generic private-key signing to app surfaces.
- Defined the wallet-provider contract and expanded the chain-provider capability schema before adding blockchain write/broadcast UI or provider behavior.
- Added wallet-provider capability-resource mapping so future `elastos://wallet/*` calls are scoped and fail closed instead of falling through to broad provider wildcards.
- Added the first `wallet-provider` capsule slice for linked-account metadata under runtime-managed storage, with proof, signing, and transaction operations failing closed until approval/proof enforcement exists.
- Extracted shared auth primitives into `elastos-auth` and added wallet-provider SIWE challenge/verify support with single-use proof challenges while keeping signing and transactions fail-closed.
- Routed browser EVM wallet login through `wallet-provider` proof challenge/verify and linked verified accounts through the provider before Runtime issues scoped Home/System grants.
- Added wallet-provider typed signing approval requests so `request_signature` records pending, principal-scoped approval state instead of exposing arbitrary signing or wallet RPC.
- Added System wallet approval review/reject APIs and UI so pending typed wallet requests can be inspected without giving apps direct wallet authority.
- Added a typed `chain-provider` rights-read seam for `has_access_by_content_id` that validates protected-content inputs and fails closed until rights ABI configuration exists.
- Added configurable `chain-provider` rights-method ABI support for `hasAccessByContentId(string,address,string) -> bool`, scoped to approved contracts/selectors and still without arbitrary RPC passthrough.

### Removed
- Removed the generic `chain-provider` `call` operation so chain access stays on reviewed typed operations instead of arbitrary `eth_call` inputs.

### Fixed
- Hardened EVM auth challenges to derive origin from the runtime request, reject client-supplied origin fields, and verify the exact runtime-issued SIWE message.
- Made source-checkout `elastos setup --list` use the checkout `components.json` before any stale installed manifest, so developer runs show current Home/blockchain profiles.
- Rejected path-like document DIDs before joining document metadata paths.
- Narrowed viewer-bound object launch tokens so a token for one content capsule cannot enumerate the full viewer library.
- Required recovery status to distinguish verified recovery protectors from merely present root-protection metadata.
- Required approved wallet requests to expire before managed signing or external wallet completion can execute.
- Updated managed-wallet namespace errors so Bitcoin-capable wallet creation no longer reports stale EVM-only guidance.
- Rendered System passkey admin actions only after the runtime access role is loaded, so admins can promote guest passkeys without reloading System.
- Persisted an explicit empty Home browser-window session after the last window closes, preventing stale windows from reopening after refresh.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Added the Home browser shell capsule, `home-cli`, and the `elastos home` command path as the visible front door.
- Added first-party System, Inbox, Library, Documents, Chat Room, GBA Emulator, and uCity browser/content capsules to the shipped Home catalog.
- Added runtime-owned browser capsule routing, object/viewer launch foundations, and app-scoped launch tokens for Home-launched surfaces.
- Added Documents provider APIs for summary, create, get, save, save-as, publish, unpublish, delete, and immutable `elastos://<cid>` document opens.
- Added Library document browsing and Chat Room attachment flow through Home orchestration instead of browser file upload.
- Added Chat Room browser-session pairing, same-browser Home session reuse, guest identity separation, guest kick controls, and runtime member invite/block controls.
- Added System appearance controls for wallpaper, reset, overlay toggle, and overlay opacity.
- Added Home PWA metadata, mobile fullscreen support, touch-first desktop icon behavior, reversible desktop icons, and mobile-safe window behavior.
- Added GBA save-state persistence, mobile touch controls, keyboard mapping labels, fullscreen ratio handling, compact controls, and fail-fast unsupported-WebView detection.
- Added shared first-party design-system docs and `scripts/home-entropy-check.mjs` for UI, naming, authority, and stale-copy drift checks.

### Changed
- Renamed the visible product front door from PC2 to Home and aligned setup profiles, proof scripts, docs, and CLI smoke tests around the Home naming.
- Replaced `md-viewer` with Documents and `room-browser` with Chat Room.
- Split setup profiles more explicitly between the core Home path, the broader demo surface, and the explicit operator lane.
- Hardened release proofing around clean-home setup, the PTY Home front door, `chat-room` packaging, source-local trusted-source checks, and Home/browser journey smoke coverage.
- Moved Home wallpaper and contrast overlay configuration into `System -> Appearance` backed by the runtime appearance store.
- Made Documents object-first: DID-backed document identity is the mutable object, `localhost://Users/self/Documents/...` is only the local working copy, and `elastos://<cid>` is the immutable published revision.
- Made Library content-first around documents and typed content instead of raw working-copy paths.
- Moved Inbox list rendering, read state, approval, denial, dismissal, and source-app open actions into the Inbox capsule; Home now owns only badge and launch.
- Aligned first-party capsule UI colors, spacing, mobile padding, and accessible controls with the shared light capsule token set.
- Aligned roadmap, principles, architecture, namespaces, and security docs around the four quadrants, object/capsule/space ontology, and capability-scoped Carrier/provider boundary.

### Fixed
- Unified main DID derivation with the device key and aligned local nickname persistence onto one shared codec.
- Removed stale live-host conflicts so managed Home/chat lanes and the explicit operator lane do not silently share one home.
- Cleaned up the public room naming so the shipped `chat-room` route, packaging, and proof tooling all agree.
- Moved Documents publish/unpublish IPFS-specific logic out of the gateway edge into the provider plane.
- Removed the gateway-owned IPFS provider bridge path; public CID reads now use cached content or the runtime provider registry and fail closed otherwise.
- Required Home authority before minting app launch tokens, app-scoped launch tokens for System and Inbox APIs, and browser-context-bound chat-room access polling.
- Redacted room bearer tokens from public/Home summaries and preferred the native Home room session over paired browser identity when both exist in one browser profile.
- Fixed browser Chat Room identity handling so messages from the native Home member no longer appear as the browser guest's own messages.
- Fixed Documents publish/unpublish behavior so unchanged content does not produce unnecessary new published revisions.
- Fixed document delete confirmation to use in-surface UI instead of browser alerts.
- Fixed Home window dragging so windows can move partially offscreen without jumping back when their title bar is clicked.
- Fixed desktop drag selection, desktop icon removal/re-add, mobile launcher focus, and maximized-window coverage over Home chrome.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Added device-backed local identity profile storage and shared DID-backed nickname handling across the CLI, did-provider, and PC2 surfaces.
- Added hosted browser-capsule foundation, the shipped `room-browser` asset set, and sovereign room invite/accept control with cross-runtime Carrier sync.
- Added explicit operator-lane setup, remote node control over Carrier, and release-line public-install/operator acceptance scripts.

### Changed
- Kept PC2 as the honest front door by surfacing room, chat, and identity flows with the current runtime and return-home contract.
- Split setup profiles more explicitly between the core PC2 path, the broader demo surface, and the explicit operator lane.
- Hardened release proofing around clean-home setup, the PTY PC2 front door, room-browser packaging, and source-local trusted-source checks.

### Fixed
- Unified main DID derivation with the device key and aligned local nickname persistence onto one shared codec.
- Removed stale live-host conflicts so managed PC2/chat lanes and the explicit operator lane do not silently share one home.
- Cleaned up the public naming around `room-browser` so the shipped browser route, packaging, and proof tooling all agree.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Removed the installer's undeclared `xxd` dependency from signature verification so minimal environments can install from the canonical gateway without extra packages.
- Pinned the documented and declared Rust toolchain to `1.89+` so fresh source builds match the actual compiler floor.
- Tightened PC2 home guidance and native chat runtime reuse so the public onboarding path stays coherent on WSL and Jetson.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Signed install, setup, and update flow with a canonical public onboarding path.
- Native Carrier chat with signed message verification, cross-host WSL ↔ Jetson proof, and same-host native ↔ WASM proof coverage.
- Capability-gated capsule execution across native runtime surfaces, WASM capsules, and microVM capsules.
- DID-backed identity, local sharing, site hosting/publish/activate/rollback, and agent capsule support.

### Changed
- The public repository starts fresh at `0.1.0`.
- `elastos chat` is native Carrier chat only; packaged chat surfaces launch through `elastos capsule ...`.
- The installer and first-run story are centered on `install.sh -> elastos setup -> elastos`.

### Removed
- Runtime/proof override residue including `ELASTOS_COMPONENTS_MANIFEST`, `ELASTOS_DEV_SEARCH`, `SkippedDevPath`, `InstalledBinaryVerification`, and `chat --mode ...`.

## Pre-public internal lineage

Earlier internal release candidates and development history existed before the public repository launch. They are intentionally not carried forward as the public release line.
